  SU2: The Open-Source CFD Code
-----------------------------------------------------------

Computational analysis tools have revolutionized the way we design aerospace systems, but most established codes are proprietary, unavailable, or prohibitively expensive for many users. The SU2 team is changing this, making computational analysis and design freely available as open-source software and involving everyone in its creation and development. 

----------------------------------------------------------
  SU2 INTRODUCTION 
----------------------------------------------------------

SU2 is a suite of open-source software tools written in C++ for the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDE) and performing PDE constrained optimization. 

The primary applications are computational fluid dynamics and aerodynamic shape optimization, but has been extended to treat more general equations such as electrodynamics and chemically reacting flows. 

SU2 is under development in the Aerospace Design Laboratory (ADL) of the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University.

  SU2 INSTALLATION
---------------------------------------------------

To build SU2 from the source code, just open a terminal and run the './configure', 'make', and 'make install' commands in the root directory of the source distribution. You can provide an install location using the prefix option to configure. If there are issues with autotool version requirements, run the ./bootstrap script provided in the root directory in order to build local versions of the tools and reset the makefiles (before trying configure/make/make install again). Please note that more detailed instructions on the configure and build processes can be found within the INSTALL file.

----------------------------------------------------------
  SU2 PATH SETUP 
----------------------------------------------------------

SU2 is built using a typical configure/make/make install process. When make install is complete, please be sure to add the $SU2_HOME and $SU2_RUN environment variables, and update your $PATH with $SU2_RUN. 

For example, add these lines to your .bashrc file:

export SU2_RUN="your_prefix/bin"
export SU2_HOME="/path/to/SU2vX.X.X/"
export PATH=$PATH:$SU2_RUN
export PYTHONPATH=$SU2_RUN:$PYTHONPATH

$SU2_RUN should point to the folder where all binaries and python scripts were installed. This is the prefix you set with the --prefix option to configure. Note that the bin/ directory is automatically added to your prefix path.

$SU2_HOME should point to the root directory of the source code distribution, i.e., /path/to/SU2vX.X.X/.

Thanks for building, and happy optimizing!
